# Data Modeling Notes

## Requirements

A client has hired you to build an API for managing `zoos` and the `animals` kept at each `zoo`. The API will be use for `zoos` in the _United States of America_, no need to worry about addresses in other countries.

For the `zoos` the client wants to record:

- name.
- address.

For the `animals` the client wants to record:

- name.
- species.
- list of all the zoos where they have resided.

Determine the database tables necessary to track this information.
Label any relationships between table.

## A good datat model

- captures ALL the information the system needs.
- captures ONLY the information the system needs.
- reflect reality (from the point of view of the system).
- is flexiblem, can evolve with the system.
- guarantees `data integrity`, without sacrificing too much performance.
- is driven by the way we access data.

## Components

- entities (nouns: zoo, animal, species), like a resource --> tables.
- properties --> columns, fields.
- relationships --> Foreign Keys (FK).

## Workflow

- identify entities (real and transactional).
- identify relationships.
- identify properties.

## Releationships

- one to one
- one to many: this is the most common!
- many to many: this is smoke and mirrors.

_there are many animals in one species_.

_there can be more than one animal in a zoo_.

_an animal could have lived in more thatn one zoo_.

## Mantras

- every table must have a **Primary Key**.
- work on **two or three** entities at a time.
- **one to many** relationships are modeled using a **Foreign Key**.
- the **Foreigh Key** always goes in the **many** side.
- the **Foreign Key Column** must be the same type as the **Primary Key** it references.
- **many to many** relationships are modeled using a **third table**.
- the third table could include other columns.
